# Project Objective

The objective of this project/product was to create a model that can utilize computer vision to detect objects of interest, such as name entities..., in documents. This is a trivial task for NLP models given access to linguistic knowledge. However, if the linguistic knowledge is not available, such as an ancient language, or a language that is unfamilar to the user, computer vision can solve the problem.

# Approach

Applying computer vision models based on Pytorch framework  


# Data

PDF files  


# Test stage
